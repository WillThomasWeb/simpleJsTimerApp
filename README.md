# simpleJsTimerApp

Simple timer app that I built following loose help of a tutorial.

Plan to add extra functionality,

Including changing colour wheel from green to red as timer runs down.

changing the background colour.

centering the app and making it responsive.

having one button that toggles between pay and pause.
